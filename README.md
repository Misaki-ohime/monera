# MONERA

Monera is a lightweight, foss and terminal-based application fully built on Python, focused on manipulating antimicrobial resistance data. With plans to work with differents antimicrobial databases (EuCAST, BrCAST, CLSI...) we expect to make research results more readable and accesible. 

## Installation

Make sure you're running ```python 3.10.X``` then, using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) install the following dependencies.

```bash
pip install fileinput, pickle, sys, tabulate, matplotlib
```

## Usage

On a terminal window, go to Monera_main.py path and open it using Python. Usually:
```bash
cd **/Monera/Monera-alfa-0.002/Monera_main.py
```

Enjoy the program. Executing Monera as root shouldn't be dangerous, but we do not recommend.

The program result for every session will be stored in the main_file's directory path.
